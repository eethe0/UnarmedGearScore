# UnarmedGearScore

Minimal VRising mod that sets player's weapon gear score to that of the last weapon equipped when switching to unarmed.

For use alongside Bloodcraft's weapon expertise and unarmed spells system, in servers where Bloodcraft leveling is disabled.

**DO NOT USE** with Bloodcraft leveling enabled, as it will interfere with the leveling system.
